            <p class="timeline-desc-p">As a programming project, Life in Orbit consisted of creating an optimised, 3D video game to emulate an astronaut's life on
              a smartphone. It involved detailed research on experiences in 'life in orbit,' with a heavy emphasis on the visual components.
              The game includes meticulously detailed 3D models of machines like the Oxygen Generation Assembly, Rehydrators, and ICE Cubes
              (International Commercial Experiments), along with 2000+ lines of code to recreate zero-gravity movement and create an 
              interesting, yet authentic problem set.

              (LESI) follows similar design ideology to vehicle suspension systems. It uses a gas piston to periodically store and release
              compressed energy to dampen the jerk-accleration acting on ankles. It uses PLA 3D prints for durability, allowing bending over 
              breaking, and comfort, which is enhanced by an ergonomic design strategy and breathable straps to secure the device.

              I programmed the bot 'Blaze.' While testing, a linear code was used which was later converted to command-based code in Java to
              allow multitasking in the robot, so it could, for instance, move and adjust viper slides at the same time.

              Working with Delphique Mercury Racing for F1 in Schools, I worked intensively on the car design, using CAD software Fusion360
              and CFD software SimScale to create an optimise a racecar, which was named Ziggy. The car was designed with a hollow section to minimise drag coupled
              with a sleek aerodynamics body. It finished in the top 10 cars of India out of 400+ models during the '24 season.

            <p class="timeline-desc-p">At Plaksha University, I worked with undergrads in CS/AI to develop a non-invasive method of detecting Parkinson’s Disease in its early stages.
              12 sensor boxes were attached throughout the body to collect data and transfer it back wirelessly using the MQTT protocol. Each sensor box
              consisted of a power supply, a voltage adapter, ESP32 (microcontroller) and an MPU6050 (accelerometer and gyroscope). Additionally,
              some included an EMG sensor (Electromyography).
